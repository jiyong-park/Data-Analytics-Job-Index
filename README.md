# Data Analytics Job Index

> *What are the skills required to become a Data Scientist?*

(e.g., https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-skills-required-to-become-a-Data-Scientist)


- From the curiosity, I developed a Web Scrapper for www.indeed.com, which is the largest job search platform, to automatically generate and visualize information about data analytics jobs as follows:
    1. How Many New Data Analytics Jobs Are in the United States?
    2. Data Analytics Job Map
    3. Required Skills for Data Analytics
    4. Data Analytics Job Characteristics
        - 4.1 Salary
        - 4.2 Company Rating
        - 4.3 Word Cloud for Job Descriptions
        - 4.4 Saving the job list as a csv file


- This can be customized for any jobs or any locations in the United States.
- Since Indeed is currently available in over 60 countries and 28 languages, you can customize this scrapper for other countries in accordance with each website (see https://www.indeed.com/worldwide).
